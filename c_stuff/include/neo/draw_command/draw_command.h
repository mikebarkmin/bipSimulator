|    Draw Commands were some of the most overlooked features of PebbleOS.      |
|    Neographics will continue to support them and even expand on them:        |
|    For example, you may have noticed that Draw Commands originally didn't    |
|    circles centered on subpixels, and that having multiple points in a       |
|    circle would lead to weird behavior in lieu of drawing multiple circles   |
|    with different centers.                                                   |
|                                                                              |
|    To facilitate these changes, neographics defines the Draw Command file    |
|    format version 2. Note that previously invalid files may now count as     |
|    valid. Neographics should be backwards-compatible with all valid files    |
|    from Draw Command version 1.                                              |
|                                                                              |
|    The `flags` byte (offset 1 in commands) now also lets users specify       |
|    specific fallback colors for b/w screens.                                 |
|                                                                              |
